## Welcome to the party y'all

This is a place for me to house all of my musings on all sorts of topics. Topics include: Linux, programming, web development, Cybersecurity, and a whole lot more. So, sit back, buckle-up, and enjoy the ride!

I am planning on storing all of my notes on all that I learn right here on this humble little corner of the web. I am also planning on writing about various projects I attempt to bring into existence. You can find all of those in the projects section.
