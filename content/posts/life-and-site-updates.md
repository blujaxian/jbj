## Starting With Life Updates

For those whom have zero clue who I am, or what I live with on a daily basis...

Hi! I'm Jason, aka blujaxian--on practically every single platform haha--and I live with schizophrenia. I'm also, at least for now, an undiagnosed AuDHDer. So, knowing this information, I'm going to assume that you, dear reader, have some idea of how chaotic, turbulent, etc., my life can get at any given moment.

Since my first post, way back in December, I have had my medications switched and unfortunate number of times--occasionally causing some serious issues; I almost checked myself into a psychiatric facility a couple of times; I have had, and still have, friends and family going through some really dark times--heartbroken to say the least; and a whole slue of other stuff that won't get mentioned here. Therefore, I have been extremely depressed and overwhelmed for quite a while now.

Now, I didn't mention any of the above for sympathy. Not even in the slightest sense. It was merely a small glimpse into why I haven't posted a single piece of content for months now haha! In fact, practically everything I have been wanting to work on, learn, etc., has had to take a backseat while I got myself together again.

## A Fresh Start and New Things to Learn

For several weeks now I have been learning the ins-and-outs of a Python framework I recently stumbled across. The framework I'm talking about is none other than: Reflex [reflex.dev](https://reflex.dev). Reflex is a full-stack Python framework for building web apps. Funny things is, I'm also learning Python itself while playing around with Reflex. I'm currently running through [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.com) and really enjoying it so far. Not to mention, enjoying learning Reflex, and to the point I am planning a rewrite of this site in Reflex. If I do go forward with this, you'll know right away haha!

I have jumped back into learning all things Cybersecurity. I am currently running through courses on the [academy.tcm-sec.com](https://academy.tcm-sec.com) platform. Once I have completed a bunch of the necessary courses to get a foothold on things, I plan to go through their Certification Programs. Truth be told, way back in the early to mid '90s, I wanted to hack all the things for all the wrong reasons. Thanks be to God, I didn't take that path!. I still haven't fully committed to what I want to zero in on just yet. But, as it stands, it's a toss up between PenTesting and Bug Bounty Hunting. So, stay tuned for the random posts and whatnot of all my endeavors with this realm of Tom foolery haha!

I recently came across the ProLUG group headed by het_tanis [His YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@het_tanis8213) [His twitch.tv channel](https://www.twitch.tv/het_tanis),  and have been going through the Linux Systems Administration course. Once I complete that I will be moving on to the Linux Systems Security course. I figured this is much needed to round out everything I'm currently wanting to accomplish.

I picked up Jay LaCroix's book *Mastering Ubuntu Server Fourth Edition* as I have some Raspberry PIs that I'd like to do some random stuff with. I really do enjoy the way Jay teaches and all of his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnLinuxTV) content is absolutely amazing. [LearnLinux.TV website](https://learnlinux.tv). Therefore, plan to be seeing a ton of posts on this endeavor as well.

A lot of planning in the background is currently underway to eventually produce video content. Time will tell if this actually takes off and becomes a thing. I truly hope I follow through haha! I've been wanting to do this for many years now, but life has a funny way of throwing wrenches in the works, so to speak.

## Things Not Tech Related

I am planning to get back to my art roots and put pencil back to paper. Now, keep in mind, I haven't drawn anything in probably 20 years at this point. But, I'm hoping it will be like riding a bike? I reckon there is only one way to find out (NIKE haha). I do have another domain that will most likely house all of my art endeavors. I'll share that URL at some point.

I have started to reconnect with my son, whom I haven't been able to be there for, for most of his life (he's 21 now). So, that has been freaking huge! He's been far exceeding anything I ever did at his age. Proud dad moment here! Unfortunately though, he's now living with a ll the psychiatric issues I deal with currently. I was hoping and praying it would pass him up--nope. It breaks my freaking heart that he's having to follow in my footsteps.

## Conclusion

If things continue like they have been going to several months now, expect to see a whole lot of content being released from me. 

Take care and God bless
